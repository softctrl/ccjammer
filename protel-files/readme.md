# Protel Files

These are the files you'll need to actually create the card itself. Using Protel software and the parts from the [BOM files](https://github.com/tourajghaffari/ccjammer/tree/master/bom-files), you should be able to create your own card.

## Contents

We have left all 3 versions here, but believe we can delete [Rev0](rev0) and [Rev1](rev1). Once someone confirms we can remove those, we will, putting all the [Rev2](rev2) files in this folder, allowing everything to move forward using those latest files.
