# CC Jammer

## Introduction

This repository has been created in honor of my father, Touraj Ghaffari. He founded [ActiveWave, Inc.](http://www.activewaveinc.com/) in 2001. It was his life work and something he loved and enjoyed thoroughly. He also loved spreading knowledge. In honor of that principle, we, his three sons, have open-sourced everything associated with his CC Jammer under the [Apache 2.0 license](license). We hope this release helps you acheive your dreams.

## What is this project?

The CC Jammer's purpose is to protect credit cards and other sensitive items that are NFC-enabled. My father made two videos, showing how they work:

* [In Wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VIWjBv9iFk)

* [Out of Wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXtZF7adKfY)

_Note: The product was being called the RFID Guardian. The project was called "ccjammer" prior to getting a name, so we're taking it back to its roots._

_Note: Any help in cleaning up the files or directory structure is very much appreciated. In particular, we're not sure whether we can remove one of the two BOMs or if we can remove any of the files from the PCB directory. We included everything we found in case any of it is useful to someone. Finally, what would be most useful - to convert the BOMs into markdown, a Google Sheet, or something else? Any and all advice is appreciated!_

## What is the state of the project?

We believe it is ready to go, as-is. However, we hope the public can review and confirm that fact - and then continue to improve on it.

## How can I get involved?

### Setup

We are unsure as to how to create a "dev setup" beyond the fact that the PCBs were designed using [Protel (now known as Altium)](http://www.altium.com/). Any help on improving this section is appreciated.

### Skilsets required

* Programming

* Soldering

* Antenna design

## Fun Touraj Fact

When asked how old he was, Touraj loved to say he was 25. We launched this on the 25th of January so it is always associated with his eternal age.
